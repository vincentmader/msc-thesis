    In our model, the star's most relevant properties will be its mass $M_*$, as well as its
    luminosity $L_*$. Both of these properties will be assumed to equal those of our own solar
    system's Sun. Thus, we define
    \begin{align*}
        M_*&:=M_\odot=\SI{1.989e30}{\kg},\ \text{and}\\
        L_*&:=L_\odot\ =\SI{3.828e26}{\joule\second^{-1}},
    \end{align*}
    where $M_\odot$ and $L_\odot$ label the solar mass and luminosity, respectively. \\
