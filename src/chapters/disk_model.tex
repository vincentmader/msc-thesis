% Intro {{{ 

    In the following we will concern ourselves with the definition of a simple model for a 
    proto-planetary disk. This model should include descriptions for both the gas and dust 
    contents of the disk as well. \\

    Before we start, it needs to be said here that due to the complexity of the involved processes 
    and the astronomically large number of particles present in the disk, our model can 
    only ever be a highly simplified approximation to reality. \\
    
    Nonetheless, it is our goal to formulate a model which captures a ``typical'' PPD's most relevant
    properties, in order to allow the conduction of studies regarding dust particle coagulation 
    and/or fragmentation in the subsequent chapters.

% Preliminary Definitions and Assumptions {{{
\section{Preliminary Definitions and Assumptions}
\label{sec:first_assumptions_about_the_disk}

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item
        % \assume{} 
        We will base this model on the aforementioned nebular hypothesis: The origin of the modeled
        proto-planetary disk is assumed to be found in the collapse of a giant interstellar cloud
        of gas and dust. 
        Having inherited its contents, the disk's elementary and material composition mirror
        that of the interstellar medium. As such, the disk contains mainly molecular hydrogen
        $\text{H}_2$, to a lesser extent mono-atomic helium $\text{He}$, and small trace amounts 
        of metals. \\

        % The disk's elementary and material composition equal that 
        % of the interstellar medium, from which it inherited its material contents.
        % \todo{Elements?}
        % As such, the elements most prevalent in the disk are hydrogen and, to a lesser extent, helium,
        % with trace amounts of metals.
        % \assume{Gas mean particle mass (weight?).}
        % TODO Rewrite

        Let $m_p$ label the mass of a single proton, and let us use $\mu$ to denote the mean
        molecular weight of the gas. Using these definitions, we can then write 
        \begin{equation}
            m_g := \mu\cdot m_p
            \ \ \ \ \ \text{with} \ \ \ \ \
            \mu := 2.3
        \end{equation}
        to express the mean molecular mass $m_g$ of an individual gas particle. \\

    % \item
        % \assume{} 
        The collapse of the interstellar gas cloud is assumed to have happened sufficiently long 
        ago such that a star could already form from the matter accumulating at the center of the
        disk. For the studies that will be carried out in the context of this thesis, this star's
        most relevant properties will be its mass $M_*$ as well as its luminosity $L_*$. 
        % \assume{}
        In the following, both of these properties will be assumed to equal those of our own solar
        system's Sun.
        Thus, we define
        \begin{align}
            M_*& := M_\odot = \SI{1.989e30}{\kg}
            ,\ \text{and} \\
            L_*& := L_\odot\ = \SI{3.828e26}{\joule~\second^{-1}},
        \end{align}
        where $M_\odot$ and $L_\odot$ label the solar mass and luminosity, respectively. \\
        % \todo{What type of star is it? Where in the main sequence is it? How old is it?} 
        % \begin{itemize}
        %     \item G-type main sequence star
        %     \item often imprecisely called "yellow dwarf" 
        %           (imprecisely, because its light is actually white)
        % \end{itemize}
        % \todo{The Sun was not as it is today when it formed $\approx$ 4.6 billion years ago.} \\

    % \item
        Like in our own Solar System, where the Sun is responsible for more than $99.9~\%$ of the 
        total mass, we will assume most of the original gas cloud's mass to be
        concentrated inside the star in our model as well, while the disk surrounding it holds only 
        a much smaller fraction of the total mass. 

    \clearpage

        Let $M_*$ and $M_\text{disk}$ label the masses of the star and the disk, respectively.
        The ratio between the two shall then be defined as
        \begin{equation}
            q_\text{disk-to-star}
                =\frac{M_\text{disk}}{M_*}  
                :=0.01
        \end{equation}

    % \clearpage
    % \item
        % \assume{
        Furthermore, the disk's mass $M_\text{disk}$ is assumed to be dominated by the contribution 
        of circumstellar gas, with only a comparatively tiny contribution of dust particles.
        Let $M_\text{dust}$ and $M_\text{gas}$ label the total mass present in the form of dust 
        and gas, respectively. Since in the context of our model the disk consists entirely out 
        of gas and dust, they must satisfy the relationship
        \begin{equation}
            M_\text{disk} = M_\text{gas} + M_\text{disk}
        \end{equation}
        The relative abundance between the two particle classes can then be encoded into the 
        dust-to-gas ratio, which we will define as
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:dust-to-gas_ratio}
            q_\text{dust-to-gas}=\frac{M_\text{dust}}{M_\text{gas}}:=0.01
        \end{equation}

        To keep things from getting too complicated, we will adopt a relatively straight-forward 
        description of the circumstellar gas particles. We will assume the validity of the ideal 
        gas law, and a perfectly isothermal behavior of the gas. 
        Moreover, let us assume the gas has had enough time to settle into hydrostatic equilibrium,
        such that the gravitational influence of the star at the disk center is balanced out by 
        an outward force due to the gas pressure gradient. \\

        The isothermal assumption allows us to relate gas pressure $P_g$, 
        gas volume density $\rho_g$, and sound speed $c_s$ via the expression
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:isothermal_condition}
            P_g = \rho_g \cdot c_s^2
        \end{equation}

        The hydrostatic assumption in turn allows us to express the relationship between 
        the gas pressure $P_g(r,z)$ and the gas volume density $\rho_g(r,z)$.
        % at a position $\vec r=(r,\phi,z)^T$ (\todo{symmetry, cyl. coords.})
        If we let $g_z$ label the acceleration due to gravity along the $z$-axis, 
        then we can write this relationship as
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium}
            \deriv{P_g}{z} = - \rho_g \cdot g_z,  % TODO Why `g_z` and not `g` ?
        \end{equation}

        Both \cref{eq:isothermal_condition} and \cref{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium} will be useful 
        in the definition of the radial gas density profiles in
        \cref{sec:gas_and_dust_density_profiles}.
        % In this simplified model, the gas is assumed to be distributed
        % For the purpose of this thesis, mass $M_\text{gas}$ is assumed to be distributed rad
        % Chemically, the gas distribution is made up 
    % \item \assume{ideal gas}
    % \item 
        % Furthermore, we assume the validity of the ideal gas law.
        % To arrive at a simplified model of the complex processes involved in 
        % gas particle interaction, we and make the following three assumptions:
        % \begin{enumerate}
        %     \item The gas can be described by the gas law.
        %     \item The gas behaves isothermal. 
        %     \item The gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium.
        % \end{enumerate}
% \end{enumerate}
    These profiles, as well as the profiles of other physical quantities, will be defined on a 
    radial axis ranging from a lower to an upper boundary, the value of which is given by
    \begin{align}
        r_\text{min} &= 10^{-2}\ \SI{}{\astronomicalunit}
        \ \ \ \ \text{and} 
        \\
        r_\text{max} &= 10^{+2}\ \SI{}{\astronomicalunit}
    \end{align}
    respectively. This radial axis is discretized into $\mathcal N_r$ bins according to the 
    definition given in \cref{sec:preliminary_notes_on_axis_discretization}. \\

    Along that axis, in the next sections we will now define the radial dependency of some of the
    disk's properties. Most notably, this includes the definition of radial profiles for the gas 
    surface \& volume densities. From these, we will then be able to derive the volume density of
    dust particles, which will be needed for the initialization of the dust particle mass 
    distribution function. \\

    %     r_\text{max} = 100\ \text{au}
    % \end{align}
    % respectively. \\

    After having defined the spatial distribution of gas and dust in the disk, later on we will 
    focus on only one specific location in the disk for the rest of this thesis. Adopting 
    cylindrical coordinates $\vec r = ( r, \phi, z )^T$, we will define the
    position of interest $\vec r_0$ as
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:definition_of_position_of_interest}
        \vec r_0 = (r_0, \phi_0, z_0 )^T

        \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \
        z_0 := 0
    \end{equation}
    % we will define $r = r_0 := 10\ \text{au}$ and $z = z_0 := 0$. 
    As such, this position of interest is at the midplane, at a distance of $10\ \text{au}$ from 
    the disk center. Assuming a radial symmetry of the disk's properties on macroscopic scales, the
    definition of a specific azimuthal angle $\phi$ becomes superfluous here.
    % Due to 
    % the assumed radial disk symmetry we can neglect the definition of the azimuthal angle $\phi$.

% Midplane Temperature {{{ 
\clearpage\subsection{Midplane Temperature}

    % The stellar luminosity $L_*$ is related to the radiation flux 
    % (i.e. energy per unit surface area per unit time) at a distance $r$ from the star.
    % \begin{align}
    %             L_*

    %     % L_* = \int\limits B(r) 4\pi r \text dr
    % \end{align}
    % here: assumption of isotropy (?)

    % to derive an expression for the temperature at the disk midplane,

    % indidence angle (flaring index)
    % \begin{equation}
    %     f = 0.05
    % \end{equation}

    The stellar luminosity $L_*$ labels the total amount of energy emitted per time by the star at 
    the center of the disk. It is related to the stellar radiation flux $B_*$ via the following 
    surface integral:
    \begin{equation}
        L_* = \int_A B_*\ \text d A
        % \ \ \ \ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \ \ \
        % B_*(r) = \frac{L_*}{4\pi r^2}
    \end{equation}
    Assuming the star's radiative power output is directed isotropically in all directions,
    we can simplify the above and then solve for the radiation flux $B_*(r)$ at 
    a distance $r$ from the star.
    \begin{equation}
        B_*(r) = \frac{L_*}{4\pi r^2}
    \end{equation}
    % Due to the high extinction coefficients in the inner midplane regions, most of the 
    % light emitted directly into the midplane will not reach the outer disk regions. 
    % Instead, these outer regions are heated by indirect radiation reaching them from

    Let $f$ denote the angle of incidence. i.e. the ``flaring angle'' of the light onto the disk, and
    assume that one half of the light is scattered into, the other out of the disk. Then, the
    radiation flux $B_\text{mid}(r)$ that actually reaches the midplane can be written as
    \begin{equation}
        B_\text{mid}(r) = \frac{f}{2} \cdot B_*(r)
        \ \ \ \ \text{with}\ \ \ \

    % light that reaches them indirectly, via 
    % scattering 
    % resulting from the

    % At a distance of $r_0 = 10\ \text{au}$
    % Only a small part of the light actually reaches the midplane at a distance $r$. 
    % Along the 
    % line of sight of 
    % A large part of 
    % the light is lost due to being emitted 
    We make the assumption that the gas and dust particles in the disk can be modeled as perfect 
    black-body objects. 
    Then, the relationship between the radiation flux $B_\text{mid}$
    % reaching the disk midplane from the star, 
    and the resulting temperature $T_\text{mid}$ 
    % at the midplane of the irradiated disk 
    is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which reads
    % coming from the star

    %  and the midplane temperature 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:stefan_boltzmann_law}

    \end{equation}
    % Here, $\sigma_\text{SB}$ labels the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which is given by 
    % \begin{equation}
    %     \sigma_\text{SB}
    %         = \frac{2\pi k_B^4}{15h^3 c^2}
    %         \approx \SI{5.670e-8}{\ \watt\ \kelvin^{-1}\ \meter^{-2}}
    % \end{equation}
    Plugging this all in and rearranging for the midplane temperature yields
    \begin{equation}
        \boxed{T_\text{mid}(r) = \bigg( \frac{f}{2} \cdot \frac{L_*}{4\pi r^2 \cdot
        \sigma_\text{SB}} \bigg)^{1/4}}

    % The relationship between the stellar luminosity $L_*$, (the total emitted energy

    \clearpage\subsection{Midplane Speed of Sound}

        The speed of sound is defined as the speed at which pressure disturbances travel in a 
        given medium. It is given by 
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:general_definition_of_sound_speed}
            c_s = \sqrt{\frac{\partial P_g}{\partial \rho_g}}
        \end{equation}
        where $P_g$ and $\rho_g$ label the gas pressure and the volume density of gas mass, respectively. 
        % Note that in our case, we have $P=P_g$ and $\rho=\rho_g$. \\
        
        % \assume{
        % As noted before, we assume the gas to behave in an isothermal manner (i.e. the
        % temperature stays constant across time.)
        % } 
        As mentioned before in \cref{sec:first_assumptions_about_the_disk}, we will assume the 
        validity of the ideal gas equation, which reads
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:ideal_gas_equation}
            P_g \cdot V = N \cdot k_B \cdot T
        \end{equation}
        Here, the number of particles per volume $N / V$ can be written as the ratio $\rho_g / m_g$
        between mass volume density $\rho_g$ and mean particle mass $m_g$. As such, we can rewrite
        \cref{eq:ideal_gas_equation} into
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:isothermal_ideal_gas_equation_of_state}
            P = \frac{\rho_g \cdot k_B \cdot T_\text{mid}}{m_g}
        \end{equation}
        Note that here we set the temperature $T = T_\text{mid}$, constraining our considerations 
        to the disk midplane. \\

        % The ideal gas equation in the disk midplane reads 
        % A gas can be approximated to be isothermal if the sound wave period is much higher than the (radiative) cooling time of the gas, as any increase in temperature due to compression by the wave will be immediately followed by radiative cooling to the original equilibrium temperature well before the next compression occurs. Many astrophysical situations in the ISM are close to being isothermal, thus the isothermal sound speed is often used. For example, in conditions where temperature and density are independent such as H II regions (where the gas temperature is set by the ionizing star’s spectrum), the gas is very close to isothermal.

        Now we can plug \cref{eq:isothermal_ideal_gas_equation_of_state} into
        \cref{eq:general_definition_of_sound_speed}, and arrive at the isothermal speed of sound

\clearpage\section{Gas and Dust Density}
\label{sec:gas_and_dust_density_profiles}

    Our next task will be to formulate a simple model for the spatial distribution of the disk's 
    gaseous contents. In this context, we will adopt cylindrical coordinates 
    $\vec r=(r, \phi, z)^T$ and define both the surface and volume density profiles along the 
    radial axis $r$.

    % Radial Profile of the Gas Surface Density {{{ 
    \subsection{Radial Profile of the Gas Surface Density}

        The gas surface density $\Sigma_g(r,\phi)$ is directly related to the gas volume density
        $\rho_g(r,\phi,z)$, and can be derived from it by integrating the volume density from 
        $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ along the $z$-axis, i.e. along the axis perpendicular to the disk:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:relationship_between_gas_surface_density_and_gas_volume_density}
            \Sigma_g(r,\phi)
                = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \rho_g(r,\phi,z)\ \dd z
        \end{equation}

        As noted in the context of the definition given in 
        \cref{eq:definition_of_position_of_interest},
        we will assume the large-scale structure of the disk to be approximately radially symmetric.
        This, of course, is quite a substantial simplification 
        that neglects the evolution of the disk structure on macroscopic scales,
        but will have to suffice as a first approximation in the context of this thesis.
        For the density distributions, assuming radial symmetry means that
        \begin{align}
            \Sigma_g(r, \phi) = \Sigma_g(r) 
            \ \ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ \
            \rho_g(r, \phi) = \rho_g(r)
        \end{align}

        Thus, we can simplify 
        \cref{eq:relationship_between_gas_surface_density_and_gas_volume_density} and write:
        \begin{equation}
            \Sigma_g(r) = \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \rho_g(r,z)\ \dd z
        \end{equation}

        Note that we do not yet have an expression for the gas volume density $\rho_g$ so far.
        Therefore, we cannot derive the surface density $\Sigma_g$ by simply evaluating the above
        integral. Instead, we will go the other way round and make an ansatz for the gas surface
        density. Then we will be able to derive the volume density from that. \\

        Here, we will 
        follow the work of Brauer, Dullemond, \& Henning \cite{brauer_dullemond_henning_2007}
        % Following the works of \cite{brauer_dullemond_henning_2007}
        % , \cite{andrews_2007}, and \cite{kitamura_2002}, 
        and make the assumption that the radial profile of the surface density can be 
        modeled using an inverse power law of the form
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:gas_surface_density_profile_inverse_power_law_ansatz}
            \Sigma_g(r) = \Sigma_0\cdot\frac{1}{r^\sigma}
            \ \ \ \ \ \text{with}\ \ \ \ \
            \sigma := 0.8
        \end{equation}  % TODO Why 0.8 ?
        Before we can use this though, we still need to define a value for $\Sigma_0$, 
        which we will do in the following: 
        The total gas mass present in the disk is given by $M_\text{gas}$, the exact numerical value 
        of which can be derived from what we defined in
        \cref{sec:first_assumptions_about_the_disk}. Since the integration of the surface density 
        over the entire disk surface must yield this value, we can formulate the following 
        condition:
        \begin{align}
            M_\text{gas}
                % &= \int_{A_\text{disk}} \Sigma_g(r) \ \dd A \\
                &= \int\limits_{r_\text{min}}^{r_\text{max}} \Sigma_g(r) \cdot 2\pi r \ \dd r
        \end{align}
        % TODO Define r_min and r_max before.

        Due to the discretization of the radial axis into $\mathcal N_r$ ``bins'', we can rewrite 
        this as
        \begin{equation}
            M_\text{gas} = \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal N_r} \Sigma_g(r_i) \cdot 2\pi r_i \cdot \Delta r_i
        \end{equation}
        % TODO Define N_r before.

        Now plug in \cref{eq:gas_surface_density_profile_inverse_power_law_ansatz} and 
        rearrange for $\Sigma_0$ to arrive at
        \begin{equation}
            \Sigma_0
                = M_\text{gas} \cdot \left[
                    \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal N_m} 2\pi r_i^{1-\sigma} \cdot \Delta r_i
                \right]^{-1},
        \end{equation}
        which is all we need to formulate an expression for the radial profile of the gas surface density.

    % Radial Profile of the Gas Volume Density {{{ 
    \newpage\subsection{Radial Profile of the Gas Volume Density}
        
        Consider again a point $\vec r=(r,\phi,z)^T$ in the disk. 
        The acceleration due to Newtonian gravity exerted by the star at the disk center 
        on a massive object at position $\vec r$ is given by
        \begin{equation}
            \vec g = -\frac{GM_*}{r^2+z^2} \cdot \frac{\vec r}{|\vec r|}
        \end{equation}

        Now consider the schematic drawing in
        \cref{fig:trigonometry_schematic_for_gas_volume_density_plot}, which we might imagine as 
        a test mass sitting at a position $\vec r$, with a radial distance $r$ from the star, and 
        a height $z$ above the midplane. Making use of basic trigonometry, we can write
        \begin{equation}
            g_z = |\vec g| \cdot \sin\theta
        \end{equation}
        and
        \begin{equation}
            \sin\theta=\frac{z}{\sqrt{r^2+z^2}}
        \end{equation}

        As already mentioned in \cref{sec:first_assumptions_about_the_disk}, the gas in the 
        proto-planetary disk is assumed to be in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium, which lets us 
        make use of \cref{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium}. If we then plug in the trigonometric 
        relations from above, we can write
        \begin{align}
            \deriv{P_g}{z}
                &= -\rho_g \cdot g_z \\
                &= -\rho_g \cdot |\vec g| \cdot \sin\theta \\
                &= -\rho_g \cdot \frac{GM_*}{r^2+z^2} \cdot\frac{z}{\sqrt{r^2+z^2}} \\
                &= -\rho_g \cdot z \cdot\frac{GM_*}{ (r^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}} }
                \label{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium_with_plugged_in_trigonometry}
        \end{align}

        As defined in \cref{eq:definition_of_position_of_interest}, the position of interest lies 
        at a distance of $10\ \text{au}$ from the star in the disk midplane. As such, we can safely
        say that $r\gg z$.
        % Let $r = r_0$, which we defined 
        % as $10 \ \text{au}$ in \cref{sec:first_assumptions_about_the_disk}. Also, 
        % this point shall 
        % be situated sufficiently close to the midplane as to allow us to write
        % Let us now make use of \cref{eq:r_much_bigger_than_z}, 
        This allows us to make the approximation
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{GM_*}{(r^2+z^2)^{3/2}} \approx \frac{GM_*}{r^3} = \Omega_K^2
        \end{equation}
        and thus, together with \cref{eq:hydrostatic_equilibrium_with_plugged_in_trigonometry},
        lets us write
        \begin{equation}
            \deriv{P_g}{z} \approx -\rho_g \cdot z \cdot \Omega_K^2
        \end{equation}

        \input{diagrams/force_balance_in_disk_with_hydrostatic_equilibrium.tex}

        The second assumption we made about the gas in \cref{sec:first_assumptions_about_the_disk}
        is that its behavior can be modeled as perfectly isothermal. 
        Consider the isothermal condition given in \cref{eq:isothermal_condition}. If we 
        differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to $z$, we get
        \begin{equation}
            \deriv{P_g}{z} = \deriv{\rho_g}{z}\cdot c_s^2
        \end{equation}

        Thus, we now have two expressions for $\text dP_g/\text dz$. Equating both of these and then 
        solving for $\text d\rho_g/\text dz$ leads to the following differential equation:
        % TODO Is it an ODE or a PDE ? Should I write `dy/dx` here, or `del y / del x` ?
        \begin{equation}
            \boxed{
                \deriv{\rho_g}{z}(r,z) 
                = -\left(\frac{\Omega_K}{c_s}\right)^2 \cdot \rho_g(r,z) \cdot z
            }
        \end{equation}

        This differential equation can be solved by making the ansatz of a Gaussian distribution
        \begin{equation}
            \boxed{
                \rho_g(r,z) = \rho_g^\text{mid}\cdot\exp\left(-\frac{z^2}{2\cdot H_p^2}\right)
            }
        \end{equation}
        where
        \begin{equation}
            H_p(r) :=\frac{c_s}{\Omega_K}  % TODO Define Kepler frequency.
        \end{equation}
        is the so-called \textit{pressure scale height} of the disk,
        $\Omega_K$ labels the Kepler frequency,
        % TODO socalled vs so-called
        and
        \begin{equation}
            \rho_g^\text{mid}(r) := \rho_g(r,z=0)
        \end{equation}
        is the gas volume density at the midplane of the disk.
        Now that we know the behavior of the gas volume density, we can easily derive it from 
        the gas surface density like this: % (\todo{Why can we do this?})
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:gas_volume_density_vs_distance_from_star}
            \boxed{\rho_g^\text{mid}(r) =\frac{\Sigma_g}{\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot H_p}}

        in \cref{eq:gas_volume_density_vs_distance_from_star}, we can use the definition of the 
        dust-to-gas ratio in \cref{eq:dust-to-gas_ratio} to obtain the 
        \textit{dust volume density}, i.e. the amount of dust mass per unit volume:
        \begin{equation}
            \rho_d(\vec r, t) = q_\text{dust-to-gas} \cdot \rho_g(\vec r, t)
        \end{equation}

        This quantity will be relevant to in the context of the studies of dust coagulation 
        and fragmentation that will be done later on, where we will model the temporal evolution of
        the distribution of dust particle masses. If we were to add up all the particles in the 
        distribution, each mutliplied by the value of its mass, then we would arrive back at this 
        value of $\rho_d$. \\

        Note that in the highly simplified model used throughout this thesis, we will assume both 
        $\rho_g$ as well as $\rho_d$ to stay constant under translations in time, as we do not 
        include the large-scale movement of matter from one region to another in the disk. \\

        Instead, we position ourselves at a position $\vec r_0$ in the disk at a time $t_0$, and
        only consider the gas and dust densities at that position, and at that point in time,
        i.e. we focus on $\rho_d(\vec r_0, t_0)$ and $\rho_g(\vec r_0, t_0)$.

        Before we can define the radial gas velocity, we first have to

        \begin{equation}

        of the molecular velocity. It is given by

        \begin{equation}

        A solution to this equation was given in 1974 by Lynden-Bell and Pringle
