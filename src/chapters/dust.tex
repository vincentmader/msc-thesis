\clearpage\section{Dust Particle Kinematics}

    The construction of the kernel matrix requires the definition of the rate 
    at which collision occur between pairs of differently sized particles.
    Therefore, it is essential to model the kinematics of the dust particles 
    in an appropriate manner and arrive at an expression for the 
    relative velocities involved in a given particle collision.
    These relative velocities will influence both the collision rate as 
    well as their outcomes, as the fragmentation probability is influenced 
    by the relative velocity as well. \\

    We include four processes in the calculation of the relative dust particle velocities.
    There are the two systematic contributions of radial and azimuthal drift, 
    and the two stochastic contributions of Brownian and turbulent motion. \\

    We will start with the definition of the systematic contributions, then move on to define 
    the stochastic contributions, and finally combine the four different effects into the 
    total relative velocity value $\Delta v_{ij}$ for a given pair of particles from 
    bin $i$ and $j$, respectively. \\

    For the definition of the radial and azimuthal velocities, as well as for Brownian motion, 
    we closely follow the work done by \cite{weidenschilling_1977}, \cite{nakagawa_1986}, 
    \cite{birnstiel_dullemond_brauer_2010}, and \cite{dullemond_dominik_2004}.

    % Radial Drift {{{ 
    \subsection{Radial Drift}

        Consider a particle suspended in a fluid flow. The ratio between the particle's 
        characteristic time scale and the characteristic time scale of the fluid flow
        is often referred to as \textit{Stokes' number}, named after George Gabriel Stokes. 
        In our model, it is given by
        \begin{equation}
            \text{St}_i=\frac{\rho_s\cdot a_i}{\Sigma_g\cdot\frac{\pi}{2}}
        \end{equation}
        % \todo{Talk about Stokes' numbers.}
        % \todo{Epstein regime} \\
        % TODO "Stokes number" vs. "Stokes' number"
        % Small particles have small Stokes numbers.

        Following the work done by \cite{birnstiel_dullemond_brauer_2010}, we will model the
        radial velocity $u_{r,i}$ of particles in the dust population corresponding to 
        a given mass bin $i$ as
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eq:radial_dust_velocity}
            u_{r,i}
            =\frac{u_{g}}{1+\text{St}_i^2}-\frac{2u_{n}}{\text{St}_i+\text{St}_i^{-1}}
        \end{equation}

        Here, the first term in the above equation is the \textit{drag term}. 
        The gas moves along 
        the radial axis with a radial velocity $u_g$
        which we defined in \cref{eq:radial_gas_velocity}.
        The value of the Stokes number affects 
        the extent to which the dust particles are coupled to the gas. In the case of a low 
        Stokes number, the dust is dragged along with the gas. \\

        The second term is related to the fact that due to the disk's own gas pressure 
        gradient, the gas in the disk orbits the disk center on a sub-keplerian 
        trajectory. Heavier particles do not feel this pressure as much and 
        thus move keplerian. As a result, there is a difference in the radial velocity
        of the dust particle and the gas through which it moves. Slowed down by the gas, 
        the particle loses momentum and starts drifting inwards. 
        The term $u_n$ labels the maximum drift velocity of a particle, which was derived 
        by \cite{weidenschilling_1977}, and is given by
        \begin{equation}
            u_{n}
            =-\pderiv{P_g}{r}\cdot\frac{E_d}{2\rho_g\Omega_K}
        \end{equation}
        Here, the drift efficiency parameter $E_d$ is set to 1 for simplicity. \\

        % \todo{particles of different size are coupled differently to the gas}
        The relative velocity is then given by
        \begin{equation}
            \Delta v_{ij}^\text{RD}
            =|u_{r,i}-u_{r,j}|

        For the calculation of the relative velocity contributions due to turbulent motion, we 
        adopt the model developed by \cite{ormel_cuzzi_2007}.
        There, relative velocity $\Delta v^\text{TU}_{ij}$ due to turbulence is defined as
        \begin{equation}
            \Delta v^\text{TU}_{ij} =

        Under this assumption, the cross section $\sigma_{ij}$ for a collision of two dust

        particles' relative velocity, and the number density of particles at the considered 
        location in the disk.

    % Collision Outcomes {{{ 
    \clearpage\subsection{Collision Outcomes}
        % Depending on the relative velocity of the two particles involved in a collision,
        % we will differentiate between three different collision outcome scenarios:

        Now that we have a description for \textit{how often} collisions between dust particles 
        will occur in our model, we have to think about how to model \textit{what happens} as a 
        result of a collision.
        The different outcome scenarios can be classified into three categories, which are 
        shortly outlined in the following. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textit{Coagulation:} Here, the two colliding particle merge into a single 
                  new particle. Mass is conserved, such that the sum of the two initial particles'
                  masses exactly equals
                % If the relative velocity is low, the two particles will merge into a single one.
                % \\ (\todo{pure "hit-and-stick" coagulation})
            \item \textit{Bouncing:} The two particles collide and bounce off of each other.
                  No particles are created or destroyed, and no mass is transferred between the 
                  particles.
            \item \textit{Fragmentation:} On or both of the particles involved in the collision 
                  breaks apart into a possibly large number of smaller, less massive particles.
                  Figuring out how to model the distribution of masses among the newly 
                  created particles in such a scenario is a problem that we will address in 
                  [\todo{cite $K_{frag}$}].
                % If the relative velocity is large enough, the collision will lead to a shattering 
                % (fragmenting) of the two particles.
        \end{enumerate}
        Which of these actually occurs as a result of a given collision of course heavily depends 
        on the details of said collision. \\

        A widely held view [\todo{cite}] is that collisions at low relative velocities could have 
        a high likelyhood of leading to a merge event, while higher velocities may lead to 
        bouncing, and still higher velocities would eventually have the effect 
        of breaking apart the particles involved in the collision. \\

        \input{diagrams/collision_outcomes.tex}

        \clearpage

        For each of the three possible outcomes, one will define an associated probability. \\
        Let $P^\text{coag}$, $P^\text{frag}$, and $P^\text{bounce}$
        label the probabilities that a collision will lead to the respective outcome. \\

        The rates at which such events occur are then given by
        \begin{align}
            R^\text{coag}_{ij}   &= R^\text{coll}_{ij} \cdot P^\text{coag}_{ij} \\
            R^\text{frag}_{ij}   &= R^\text{coll}_{ij} \cdot P^\text{frag}_{ij} \\
            R^\text{bounce}_{ij} &= R^\text{coll}_{ij} \cdot P^\text{bounce}_{ij}
        \end{align}

        Collisions in the scenario of bouncing do not have an effect on the dust mass distribution
        among particles. But since a high value of $P_\text{bounce}$ will lead to lower reaction 
        rates for the other two collision outcomes, the inclusion of bouncing effectively 
        "slows down" the simulation. \\

        In the context of this thesis, we will not take the effect of bouncing into account, and 
        only model the influence of coagulation and fragmentation processes. As wuch, we will adopt 
        a bouncing probability of $P^\text{bounce}=0$. \\

        To help with the decision whether a given collision will end up resulting in 
        coagulation or fragmentation, the definition of a
        \textit{threshold value for the relative velocity} makes sense.
        Adopting the value used in [\todo{cite kees}],
        we will define the value of $v_\text{threshold}$ as
        \begin{equation}
            v_\text{threshold} := \SI{1}{\meter\second^{-1}}
        \end{equation}

        Assuming a "hard decision boundary", the fragmentation probability $P^\text{frag}_{ij}$ 
        for a collision involving two particles of masses $m_i$ and $m_j$ could be expressed as
        \begin{equation}
            P^\text{frag}_{ij}
            =
            \begin{cases}
                1 & \text{if}\ \Delta v_{ij} >= v_\text{threshold}\\
                0 & \text{else}
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}

        A more elegant way though is given by \todo{\cite{stammler_birnstiel_2022}}.
        Here, a correction using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is made to the 
        fragmentation probability: 
        \begin{equation}
            x:=\frac{3}{2}\cdot\bigg(
                \frac{v_\text{frag}}{\Delta v_{ij}}
            \bigg)^2
        \end{equation}
        
        \begin{equation}
            P^\text{frag}_{ij}=(1+x)\cdot e^{-x}
        \end{equation}

        The resulting probability densities for the first method and the second, more sensible 
        one are displayed in \todo{ref figs}.

        % Since the kinematics of circumstellar dust particles are influenced by both systematic and 
        % stochastic contributions (e.g. Keplerian and Brownian motion, respectively), occasional
        % particle collisions are to be expected. At a given time $t$ and position $\vec r$ in the
        % disk, let us write $$R^\text{coll}(m,m')$$ to denote the rate of collisions between two
        % particles carrying the masses $m$ and $m'$, respectively. \\

        % \todo{This rate will be defined further in... [ref. chapter]} \\
        
        % The outcome of a collision between such a particle pair depends (\todo{among other things})
        % on the relative velocity between the two particles, and can be classified into 3 distinct 
        % categories, namely (pure hit-and-stick) coagulation, fragmentation, and bouncing.\\

        % \todo{They will be defined in... [ref. chapter]} \\ 
        
        % to denote the probability that such a collision will lead to a 
        % merging of the two collision partners into a single new particle. Analogously, 
        % labels that rate of collisions leading to fragmentation of the two 
        % particles into a range of newly created, smaller particles.

        % $R^\text{coag}(m,m',\vec r,t)$ label the rate of 
        % collisions leading to the merging of two particles carrying the masses $m$ and $m'$, respectively. 
        % Analogously, let $R^\text{frag}(m,m',\vec r,t)$ be the rate of collisions leading to particle 
        % fragmentation.\\
