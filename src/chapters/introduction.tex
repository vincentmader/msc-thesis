% Intro to Intro - What is this about? {{{ 

As of this writing, the mechanisms involved in planetary formation are still far from being fully 
understood. Accurate modeling of the underlying processes requires an understanding of a wide 
variety of different sub-fields of the natural sciences, 
including (but not limited to)
% making it quite a complex field of study.
gravitational N-body dynamics,
thermodynamics and radiative transfer,
magneto-hydro-dynamics,
cosmo-chemistry, and 
coagulation physics. \\

Bringing all of these different aspects % (and more) 
together in a sensible fashion is not easy,
thus making this quite a complex field of study. 
We are not helped by the fact that it is basically impossible to directly run experiments 
on planet formation in the laboratory. Due to the involved scales with respect to e.g. 
time, distance, mass, and energy,
studies in the laboratory can only be made when focusing on a very small subset of the 
questions that we would like to have answered.
As such, apart from telescope observations, we often have to rely on numerical techniques to gain 
insight into the respective processes, running simulations based on highly simplified theoretical 
models. \\

Various frameworks exist for constructing such models for different aspects of the planetary 
formation process. 
One such framework, which is of great relevance to the studies done in the context of this thesis,
is given by the so-called \textit{Smoluchowski coagulation equation}. \\

This equation allows the definition of a model for the temporal evolution of a given particle 
group's distribution of masses under the influence of particle collisions and subsequent 
merging and/or fragmentation events. 
As such, the framework provided by this equation can be used to study the agglomeration of
particles in young proto-planetary disks. More precisely, we will use this framework to study the 
evolution of the mass distribution of \textit{circumstellar dust particles},
% and the role that dust plays in the early phases of 
% planetary formation. \\
which are widely believed to play an imporant role in the early phases of planetary core 
formation. \\

Previous studies of dust particle agglomeration that made use of the framework provided by the 
Smoluchowski coagulation equation have often made the simplifying assumption that the individual 
dust particles can be characterized entirely by the value of their mass alone (see e.g. 
    \cite{dullemond_dominik_2004},
    \cite{birnstiel_dullemond_brauer_2010}). 
This is due to the fact that the numerical integration of the Smoluchowski equation from one 
time-step to the next involves the evaluation of a summation over 
the multi-dimensional \textit{kernel matrix}.
The inclusion of a second attribute like, for instance \textit{particle porosity}, greatly 
increases the dimensionality of the kernel, which leads to a significant increase in the 
computational cost required for the integration. \\

In this thesis, we explore the possibility of lowering this computational cost via the 
utilization of stochastic Monte Carlo sampling of the kernel matrix. The central idea here is 
to include only the most relevant sum terms, where relevance is determined by both the rate of 
a given collision,  as well as by the effect that it will have on the particle mass distribution
function.

% Thesis Structure {{{ 
\section{Structure of this Thesis}

The thesis will be structured as follows: To get started, in \cref{sec:prerequisites} we will 
give a short overview of a number of widely accepted ideas which are related to the origin and 
formation of proto-planetary disks and the processes related to planet formation within them. \\

Following that, in \cref{sec:preliminary_notes_on_axis_discretization} and 
\cref{sec:preliminary_notes_on_the_dust_model}, we will lay out a few preliminary notes
which are related to the discretization of axes, as well as to the method that will be used 
for modeling the properties of both the individual dust particles, as well as the overall
distribution of dust particles masses inside the proto-planetary disk. \\

Then, we will continue with the definition of a simplified disk model in \cref{ch:disk}. 
This model should include the most relevant properties of both the disk itself, as well as its 
gas and dust contents. In the subsequent sections, it will be used to model the dust particle 
kinematics, and from that define the dust particle collision rates, which will be an essential 
part of our dust coagulation model. \\

In \cref{ch:smoluchoswki} we will then utilize the Smoluchowski coagulation equation to build a 
simple model of the dust particle mass distribution's temporal evolution under 
the influence of particle collisions and the following associative/dissociative events. 
The definition of a dust coagulation model will involve 
% the discretization of the mass axis, 
the construction of a kernel matrix for both coagulation and fragmentation processes,
as well as the implementation of a method for numerically integrating the Smoluchowski 
equation using a 4th order implicit Radau integration scheme. \\

Having constructed the complete kernel matrix, in \cref{ch:sampling} we will finally focus on 
the implementation of stochastic kernel sampling using a Monte Carlo method. 
Here, the task is to identify the most relevant collisions at a given point in time,
define a sensible probability distribution from that, and conduct a random sampling of all possible 
collisions. Including only the chosen collisions, a new (incomplete) kernel matrix is then 
defined in each time-step, with which the numerical integration is subsequently carried out.

\section{Short Introduction to Planet Formation}
\label{sec:prerequisites}

    % The following attempts to provide a brief overview of a number of widely accepted ideas 
    % that are central to mankind's understanding of the origin and formation of the Universe 
    % and planets within it:

    Directly after the Big Bang, the conditions in the young Universe were not favorable for the
    formation of large-scale structures. Extremely high temperatures prevented the agglomeration 
    of smaller particle constituents into more complex structures. \\

    Current consensus has it that it took approximately 380.000 years for
    the initial hot quark-gluon plasma to be cooled down sufficiently by 
    the expansion of the Universe to enable 
    the creation of the first hadronic matter via 
    a combination of multiple quarks into one particle. 
    For us, the most relevant of these quark combinations were of course the proton and the neutron,
    as they provided the building blocks for the nuclei of the first atoms. 
    Subsequently, the capture of electrons by these atomic cores lead to the creation of neutral 
    atoms. As they make up the most basic elements in the periodic table due to their simple 
    atomic structure, 
    the elemental composition of the early Universe was dominated by the contribution 
    of hydrogen present in the form of molecular gas and, to a lesser extent, 
    mono-atomic helium. \\

    Apart from trace amounts of metals that were formed mostly via nuclear fusion inside stellar 
    cores, this statement about the chemical composition of the Universe is still valid today. 
    % As such, the material make-up of the regions between individual stellar systems is still 
    % dominated by the contribution of the just mentioned types of matter.
    Though much less abundant, the presence of these metals is assumed to be essential for the 
    formation of planets, as they provide the material for a central rocky core. Initially,
    they are present in forms of dust particles, which are 
    composed of various materials like silicates, carbon compounds, or ices.

    % Even though 
    %  The dust grains in protoplanetary disks are typically composed of various materials, including silicates, carbonaceous compounds, ices (such as water ice, ammonia ice, methane ice), and organic molecules.

%     % The Interstellar Medium {{{
\clearpage\subsection{The Interstellar Medium}

    % What is the interstellar medium?
    The term \textit{interstellar medium} (ISM) is used to denote the matter and radiation that 
    can be found in the expanse of space between the stellar systems inside a galaxy. 
    As we will discuss further in the following sections, the ISM is widely considered to serve 
    as the birthplace of proto-planetary disks (PPDs), and subsequently, stars and planets. \\

    At first glance, it might not be easy to imagine how such giant objects like planets and 
    even stars can form in the ISM. After all, one might naively say that it consists of mostly
    nothing. From the point of view of a human living on Earth, the interstellar regions of
    space appear to be a near-perfect vacuum. 
    Measurements of the the molcular particle number density in the ISM have been made in 
    previous studies by e.g. \cite{burton_2013}, where they showed that the number of
    particles per unit volume can range from approximately $\SI{1e16}{\meter^{-3}}$ all the way 
    down to $\SI{1e3}{\meter^{-3}}$. \\

    The exact value of the particle number density depends of course heavily on the precise 
    location. Nonetheless, a comparison of the mere orders of magnitude involved 
    here demonstrates the huge difference in particle abundances in the ISM when compared to 
    Earth, where the number\footnote{Here we assume the validity of the ideal gas law, 
        a sea-level pressure of $p=\SI{1}{\bar}$, and a temperature of $T=\SI{25}{\celsius}$.}
    of gas molecules inside the atmosphere is approximately $\SI{1e25}{\meter^{-3}}$. \\

    Under the influence of gravity, the material in the ISM can gather into what is 
    appropriately called \textit{giant interstellar clouds}.
    % Over time scales of (\todo{approx. how many years?}), the material in the ISM 
    % will, under the effect of gravity, gather in giant interstellar clouds. 
    Examples of such clouds are given by e.g. the Orion Nebula,
    which can be seen with the naked eye as the ``sword'' in the Orion constellation,
    or the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the famous \textit{Pillars of Creation}.
    Measurements of these two can be seen visualized in 
    \cref{fig:star_forming_regions}. \\

    The fact that giant astronomical objects like PPDs, stars, and planets can form from the 
    low volume densities of the material found in the ISM, may be understood more easily if one
    brings to mind the absolutely enormous scales of both space and time that are involved here. \\

    % \todo{Images of interstellar gas clouds, star-forming regions.} \\
    % \todo{How big are they? How many light years across, approximately?} \\

    % The material making up these clouds can be classified into three main categories:

    %     \item Molecular Gas: \\
    %         \todo{Mostly diatomic hydrogen $\text{H}_2$.} \\

% The Nebular Hypothesis {{{ 
\clearpage\subsection{The Nebular Hypothesis}

    But how \textit{do} stars, and the planetary systems surrounding them, form in these regions?
    One explanation is given by 
    the so-called \textit{nebular hypothesis}, which provides a widely accepted model for 
    explaining the formation and evolution of not only our own Solar System, but the planetary 
    systems around other stars as well. 
    It was postulated independently by Immanuel Kant        % TODO cite
    and Pierre-Simon Laplace                                % TODO cite
    in 1755 and 1796, respectively. \\                      % TODO "independently" is that true?

    The hypothesis is built upon the idea that the formation of proto-planetary disks, and thus 
    stellar systems, can be explained via the gravitational collapse of interstellar clouds 
    of gas and dust. \\
    % (\todo: Examples for such star-forming regions, see above [cite]) \\
    % \todo{(molecular clouds)}

    Such a collapse may be induced by external influences, like e.g. a shock-wave from a nearby 
    supernova explosion, or just happen due to an irregular distribution of matter in the cloud, 
    leading to a graviational instability. \\

    When such a cloud falls in on itself, one might naively think that this leads to the 
    entire matter collapsing into a single point. But since the cloud possesses a total angular 
    momentum which is most likely $\neq 0$, this does not happen. 
    Instead, the cloud flattens into a disk-like structure, where gravitational influences
    are only balanced out along the radial axis by centrifugal forces. 
    Such a disk will also not continue to flatten into an infinitesimally thin structure.
    This is due to the non-zero temperatures and the internal gas pressure support along the 
    $z$-axis, i.e. the axis orthogonal to the disk. \\

    In the center/core of the disk, densities and temperatures may increase to a point that 
    nuclear fusion becomes possible, and a star can form. 
    The result is a proto-planetary disk, examples of which can be detected all around our own 
    location in the Milky Way. Examples of observations of such objects can be seen visualized 
    in \cref{fig:ppd_alma_observations}.

% The Road from Dust to Planet {{{ 
\clearpage\subsection{The Road from Dust to Planet}

    In the early stages of planet formation, gravity most likely does not play a dominant role in 
    particle agglomeration processes. Instead, dust grains composed of the afore-mentioned 
    materials collide and then stick together mainly 
    via microphysical processes like van der Waals or Coulomb interactions. 
    Over time, larger and larger structures form from initially tiny particles, such that
    the range of dust particles sizes can range from microns up to 
    millimeter and centimeter sizes, more similar to ``sand and pebbles'' than to grains.
    \cite{natta_2006} \\

    % (Ward, William R., 1996). 
    This process of dust coagulation is not still entirely understood today. For example, 
    there remains the unanswered question of how exactly it is possible for these aggregates to 
    continue growing 
    % into larger and larger structures,
    without fragmenting into smaller pieces again when collisions with other particles occur.
    % exactly the early planet cores manage to grow without fragmenting into smaller pieces again at
    % collisions with other, similarly-sized planetesimals. % (Morbidelli and Raymond, 2016). 
    Assuming this so-called fragmentation barrier and other barriers can be overcome though, 
    ever larger structures emerge as particles collide and stick to each other. 
    From the initial dust particles, fractal-shaped 
    ``dust bunnies'' form, which themselves over long time-scales may evolve into pebbles. \\
    % then bigger ones, and 

    The presence of these pebbles may at some point allow
    the formation of large enough structures such that one could reasonably speak of
    \textit{planetesimals}. 
    The gravitational influence of these bodies can then become strong enough to 
    assist in the sticking of smaller grains to the planetesimals, as well as the 
    accretion of gas. \\

    Most modern planet formation models assume the initial buildup of a rocky core, which 
    subsequently may develop into a terrestrial planet, or into a giant planet consisting of a 
    rocky core surrounded by a large gaseous hull. 
    % ! Recent planet formation models mostly assume the initial buildup of a central rocky core. 
    % From this point on, the proto-planet may either develop into a terrestrial planet or into a 
    % giant planet consisting of a rocky core and a large gaseous hull. 
    In our own Solar System, the
    four terrestrial planets 
    Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars
    are situated closest to the Sun, whereas the four gas giants 
    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune 
    orbit the Sun at much greater distances, 
    in the outer regions of the Solar System. \\

    Most likely, this is no coincidence. 
    As was already mentioned, the greater part of matter in the universe 
    (and therefore also of most matter in newly formed disks), 
    consists of light elements like hydrogen and helium. 
    Because of radiation pressure induced by solar wind, these light elements are pushed outwards 
    away from the disk center, and accumulate in its outer regions. 
    Therefore, an accreting planetoid in the outskirts of the disk has 
    much more gaseous material available for accretion in its vicinity than one positioned close to 
    the center. \\

    In this thesis, we will focus on the very early stages of the dust coagulation process,

    of dust particle masses as well as its temporal evolution. \\

% Preliminary Notes on Axis Discretization {{{
\clearpage\section{Preliminary Notes on Axis Discretization}
\label{sec:preliminary_notes_on_axis_discretization}

    In order to do this, we will have to deal with several physical quantities 
    that carry values ranging across many orders of magnitude. Most notably, these quantities are 
    time, distance, and mass. \\

    As mentioned earlier, the Smoluchowski coagulation equation serves as the foundation for the 
    coagulation model 
    that we will build. Since this integro-differential equation has analytical solutions in 
    only a limited set of cases, it will be necessary to make use of numerical integration 
    techniques to obtain an approximate solution for the evolution of the dust particle mass 
    distribution in the considered disk region. Before numerical integration, the axes for the 
    above-mentioned physical quantities will have to be discretized in an appropriate manner. \\

    As an example, we will here demonstrate how one might do this for the mass axis $m$. 
    The construction of the discrete axes for both space (i.e. radial distance $r$ from the 
    central star) and time $t$ can then be done entirely analogously. \\

    The continuous range $m$ of particle masses present in the disk is to be partitioned into a 
    set of $\mathcal N_m\in\mathbb N$ intervals, which we will refer to as ``bins'' from this 
    point onwards. Each of these bins can be uniquely characterized by an index 
    $i\in[1,\mathcal N_m]\cap\mathbb N$, and assigned a corresponding mass value $m_i^\text{c}$, 
    which is situated at the \textit{center of the bin} (ergo the superfix ``c'').\\
    
    To derive an expression that can be used to calculate the mass values at these bin centers, 
    let us first define the mass values at the \textit{boundaries of the bins}. To do this,
    consider a collection of $\mathcal N_m+1$ appropriately spaced grid points $m_i^\text{b}$. 
    The first and last of these values, i.e. the lower and upper boundaries of the discrete mass 
    grid, shall be labeled $m_\text{min}$ and $m_\text{max}$, respectively. \\

    The spacing of the grid points of course depends heavily on the utilized scaling. In
    \cref{subsec:axis_discretization_with_linear_scale} and
    \cref{subsec:axis_discretization_with_logarithmic_scale}, we will go into more detail on how 
    exactly the values for $m_i^\text{b}$ and $m_i^\text{c}$ are to be defined when making use of 
    a linear and logarithmic scaling, respectively. 
    If not specified otherwise, throughout this
    thesis we will always use the logarithmic scaling for the discretization of the axes for mass,
    distance, and time. Also, we we will mostly be considering the grid values at the bin centers,
    and for thus for reasons of readibility refrain from including the superfix into the equations. 
    % TODO Assure consistent usage of \text{b} and \text{c}.

    % For the moment, a schematic represenation of the continuous mass axis and its discrete analogon

    \label{subsec:axis_discretization_with_linear_scale}

        For the sake of simplicity, let us assume a linear scaling at the moment. Later on, we 
        will make use of a logarithmic scaling instead, which will help us assure a more 
        appropriate representation of all values along the wide range of dust particle masses 
        that are present in the proto-planetary disk. \\
    
        For a given bin, which can be characterized by an index $i$, the mass value corresponding 
        to this bin's lower boundary shall be labeled $m_i^\text{b}$. When using a linear scaling,
        it can be expressed as
        \begin{align}
          m_i^\text{b}=m_\text{min}+(m_\text{max}-m_\text{min})\cdot\frac{i}{\mathcal N_m}
        \end{align}

        Having derived the mass values at the boundaries of each bin, it is now quite easy to 
        calculate the corresponding values at the bin center. To do this, all we need to do is take 
        the arithmetic mean of the two boundary values:
        \begin{equation}
            m_i^\text{c}
                =\frac{m_i^\text{b}+m_{i+1}^\text{b}}{2}
        \end{equation}
        
        Thus, after having defined only the three numbers $\mathcal N_m$, $m_\text{min}$, and 
        $m_\text{max}$, it is possible to interpolate the values of all mass grid points positioned 
        on both the boundaries as well as the  centers of the bins. \\
        
        The inverse transformation from mass to index can be derived easily by rearranging the 
        above relation, which leads to the following expression:
        \begin{equation}
            i(m)
                =\mathcal N_m\cdot\frac{m-m_\text{min}}{m_\text{max}-m_\text{min}}
        \end{equation}
        
        % Sidenote: In the linearly scaled mass grid, the bin "width" is constant, and independent of the 
        % bin index. This will change once the switch to a logarithmic grid is made! For now though, it is 
        % given by
        % \begin{align}
        %   \Delta m
        %   &=m_{i+1}^\text{b}-m_i^\text{b}\\
        %   &=\frac{m_\text{max}-m_\text{min}}{\mathcal N_m}
        % \end{align}

    % Axis Discretization with Logarithmic Scaling {{{ 
    \subsection{Axis Discretization with Logarithmic Scaling}
    \label{subsec:axis_discretization_with_logarithmic_scale}

        The procedure for constructing the discretized axis using a logarithmic scaling works quite
        analogously to what we just saw in the linear case. The main difference is that we will 
        switch out addition/subtraction by multiplication/division, and multiplication/division 
        by exponentiation.
        \\

        As before, let $\mathcal N_m$ label the total number of bins, each of which can be uniquely 
        identified by an index $i\in\mathcal[1,\mathcal N_m+1]$. Once again, we will first define 
        an expression for the grid points sitting directly on the lower boundary of each bin. When
        making use of a logarithmic scaling, these values are given by
        \begin{equation}
            m_i^\text{b}
                =m_\text{min}\cdot\left(\frac{m_\text{max}}{m_\text{min}}\right)^{i/\mathcal N_m}
        \end{equation}
        To arrive at the mass values at the bin centers, we again take the mean. Contrary to the 
        linear case, here we are not using the arithmetic mean though, but the geometric mean
        instead:
        \begin{align}
            m_i^\text{c}
                =\sqrt{m_i\cdot m_{i+1}}
        \end{align}
    
        As in the linear case, the inverse transformation can easily be arrived at by rearranging
        for the bin index $i$, which leads to the following expression:
        \begin{align}
            i(m) = \mathcal N_m\cdot \frac{
                \log(m)-\log(m_\text{min})
            }{
                \log(m_\text{max})-\log(m_\text{min})
            }
        \end{align}
        
        In contrast to the linear grid, where the ``bin width'', i.e. the additive offset between bins
        \begin{equation}
            \Delta m := m_{i+1} - m_i
        \end{equation}
        is the same for all bins, in the logarithmic grid this is not the case. Instead, what stays
        constant here is the \textit{relative} mass increase from one bin to the next:\footnote{This
        is true only up to the machine precision of the utilized computer setup.}
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{m_i^\text{c}}{m_i^\text{c}}
                =\frac{m_i^\text{b}}{m_i^\text{b}}
                =\text{const.}\ \forall i\in[1,\mathcal N_m]
        \end{equation}

\clearpage\section{Preliminary Notes on the Dust Model}
\label{sec:preliminary_notes_on_the_dust_model}

    Let us now turn our attention to the question of how one might model the individual 
    dust particles present in the proto-planetary disk.
    Here, it will be necessary to make simplifying assumptions, that obviously cannot 
    reflect physical reality, but must suffice as an approximate model. \\

    % The Individual Dust Particles {{{ 
    \subsection{The Individual Dust Particles}

        % \assume{
        In the context of this thesis, we will model the individual dust particles as perfectly 
        spherical bodies, all possessing a shared solid density $\rho_s$. This allows us to 
        group the particles into different classes, each uniquely identified by the particles' 
        mass value $m$. \\

        Also, this shape allows us state the following relationship between 
        particle mass $m$ and radius $a$:
        % }
        \begin{align}
            m
                =\rho_s \cdot \frac{4\pi}{3}a^3
            \ \ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ \
            a
                =\bigg(\frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{m}{\rho_s}\bigg)^{1/3}
        \end{align}

        Building upon prior work done in the 2010 paper by Birnstiel, Dullemond \& Brauer 
        % TODO Use Oxford comma?
        \cite{birnstiel_dullemond_brauer_2010}, we will assume that the solid density of the dust 
        particles carries a value of
        \begin{equation}
            \rho_s = \SI{1600}{\kilogram~\meter^{-3}}
        \end{equation}
        % TODO Increase spacing in `\SI` renders, here & elsewhere.

        In reality, as a result of collisions leading to sticking, these dust particles can 
        take on very complex, fractal shapes.
        This complicated structure makes a detailed treatment of large particle numbers 
        basically impossible. Instead, highly simplified assumptions have to be made,
        visualizations of which are displayed schematically in 
        \cref{fig:shapes_of_dust_particles}.

        % In the context of this thesis, we will adopt a minimum and maximum mass value of 
        % $10^{-4}~\text{kg}$ and $10^{-4}~\text{kg}$

% The Dust Particle Mass Distribution Function {{{ 
\clearpage\subsection{The Dust Particle Mass Distribution Function}
\label{sec:dust_particle_mass_distribution}

    The concept of the \textit{dust particle mass distribution function} $n(m, \vec r, t)$ 
    lies at the heart of the dust coagulation model that was built for this thesis. 
    This function is defined in such a way that, at a given time $t$ and position $\vec r$ 
    in the disk, the expression
    \begin{equation}
        N(\vec r, t) =\int\limits_0^\infty n(m,\vec r, t)\ \dd m
    \end{equation}
    denotes the total number of dust particles $N$ per unit volume, i.e. the dust particle
    number density, at the considered region in the proto-planetary disk. 
    Its relationship to the mass volume density $\rho_d$ of the dust at a given position 
    $\vec r$ in the disk is given by
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:relationship_between_dust_particle_mass_distribution_and_mass_volume_density}
        % \rho_\text{dust} = 
        \rho_d(\vec r, t) =\int\limits_0^\infty n(m,\vec r, t)\cdot m\ \dd m
    \end{equation}

    % The temporal evolution of the functions $n$, $N$, and $\rho_g$ will be of great interest 
    % throughout this thesis.

% \subsection{Discretized Formulation}

    Before we can use numerical integration techniques to calculate an approximate solution to 
    the Smoluchowski coagulation equation, it will be necessary to define an analogous, 
    but discretized formulation of the expressions we defined above. \\

    Let $m_i$ label the mass values along the discretized mass axis we defined in
    \cref{sec:preliminary_notes_on_axis_discretization}.
    Specifically, with this we mean the mass values $m_i^c$ at the bin centers, and onwards 
    from here we will do so everywhere in this thesis, if not otherwise specified. 
    As before, the number of bin is labeled $\mathcal N_m$, with an lower and upper axis 
    boundary $m_\text{min}$ and $m_\text{max}$, respectively. The mass ``width'' of a given bin 
    at a position $i$ in the grid is labeled $\Delta m_i$. \\

    We will begin with the discretized particle mass distribution function.
    For this, let us introduce the notation
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:discrete_formulation_of_particle_mass_distribution}
        n_i := n(m_i)
    \end{equation}

    The total number of dust particles per unit unit volume corresponding to a given bin $i$ 
    is then calculated by integrating the particle mass distribution function from the lower 
    to the upper bin boundary:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:relationship_between_dust_particle_mass_distribution_and_particle_number_density}
        N_i 
        &= \int_{m_{i-1/2}}^{m_{1+1/2}}n(m)\ \dd m \\
        &\approx n_i \cdot \Delta m_i 
        % \ \ \ \textcolor{red}{??}
    \end{align}
    
    The mass density $\rho_i$, i.e. the dust mass per unit volume belonging to a bin $i$ is 
    then given by
    \begin{align}
        \rho_i 
        &= \int_{m_{i-1/2}}^{m_{1+1/2}} m \cdot n(m)\ \dd m \\
        &\approx n_i \cdot m_i \cdot \Delta m_i 
    \end{align}
    
    Since each bin in the mass grid contains only a fraction of the total dust mass density
    $\rho_d(\vec r)$ at a given point $\vec r$ in space, we have to sum over all bins
    to arrive at the total mass density independent of particle mass:
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:relationship_between_discretized_dust_particle_mass_distribution_and_mass_volume_density}
        \rho_d = \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal N_m} \rho_i
    \end{align}

    Studying the temporal evolution of the functions $n_i$, $N_i$, and $\rho_i$ will be 
    one of this thesis' main goals.
    % \todo{but $\rho_d$ is constant. (mass conservation)}

% }}}
% Initialization of the Dust Particle Mass Distribution {{{ 
\clearpage\subsection{Initialization of the Dust Particle Mass Distribution}

    Before the temporal evolution of the dust mass distribution can be addressed, it is of 
    course necessary to define initial conditions. For this, let us label the initial state 
    of the dust particle mass distribution function as well as the particle number density
    \begin{align}
        n_0 &:= n(m=m_0, \vec r=\vec r_0, t=0) 
        \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \\
        N_0 &:= N(m=m_0, \vec r=\vec r_0, t=0)
    \end{align}
    respectively. Here, $\vec r_0$ labels the position in the disk where the simulation takes
    place. \\

    At the beginning of a given simulation, we will assume all dust particles to share the same 
    mass $m_0$ and the same corresponding radius.
    The appropriate particle mass distribution function for the this scenario is given by a 
    Dirac $\delta$-distribution:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:dirac_delta_identity}
        n(m, \vec r, t=0) = \delta_D(m-m_0) \cdot n_0  
    \end{equation}
    % Here, the normalization constant $n_0$ is the initial number of particles 
    % with mass $m_0$ per unit volume. NO!
    % TODO assume large scale dust density does stay constant

    Plugging the above definition back into
    \cref{eq:relationship_between_dust_particle_mass_distribution_and_mass_volume_density}
    leads to
    \begin{align}
        \rho_d(\vec r, t=0) 
            &= \int\limits_0^\infty n(m, \vec r, t=0) \cdot m\ \text dm \\
            &= \int\limits_0^\infty \delta_D(m-m_0) \cdot n_0 \cdot m\ \text dm \\
            &= N_0 \cdot m_0
    \end{align}
    This reflects the fact that we initially want to have $N_0$ particles per unit volume, each 
    carrying a mass of value $m_0$. \\

    Now we would like to define a discretized analogon of the above.
    To do this, we can use the Kronecker $\delta$-function to define list of numbers with length
    $\mathcal N_m$, consisting of $\mathcal N_m-1$ zeros, and a single non-zero value $n_0$ as the 
    first entry.
    \begin{equation}
        n_i(t=0) = \delta_{ij} \cdot n_0
        \ \ \ \ \ \text{where } \ \ \ \ \ 
        j=0
    \end{equation}
    Plugging this definition into 
    \cref{eq:relationship_between_discretized_dust_particle_mass_distribution_and_mass_volume_density}
    yields
    \begin{align}
        \rho_d 
            &= \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal N_m} n_i \cdot m_i \cdot \Delta m_i \\
            &= \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal N_m} \delta_{i0} \cdot n_0 \cdot m_i \cdot \Delta m_i \\
            &= \cdot n_0 \cdot m_0 \cdot \Delta m_0
    \end{align}

    % \begin{equation}
    %     n_i \cdot m_i \cdot \Delta m_i = \rho_d
    % \end{equation}

    If not specified otherwise, the initial particle mass will be set to $m_0 = m_c^1$ for the
    remainder of this thesis. This is the mass value at the center of the first (``smallest'') bin 
    in the discretized mass axis.
