    abstract = {The effects of coarse mass-coordinate divisions in numerical computations of the coagulation equation are examined. The numerical accuracy is essential to the estimate of the growth times of dust and planets. Three different logarithmic divisions with common ratios of √2, 2, and 8 are used to numerically solve the coagulation equation in cases of simple coalescence rates, where analytic solutions are known. The comparison of numerical solutions and analytic ones shows appreciable discrepancies between them and the discrepancies are quite large in the cases of larger common ratios; the coagulation is considerably accelerated. Comparison between the simulations of planetary growth with these three types of divisions is also made to show that growth time in early stages differs by a factor of about 10 between the cases of common ratios √2 and 8. This suggests that the previous numerical simulations of the coagulation process using coarse divisions with common ratios of 2 or 8 were very likely affected by this artificial acceleration.}

title = {COLLISIONAL GROWTH CONDITIONS FOR DUST AGGREGATES},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Collisions between dust aggregates are the key to understand the formation of planetesimals because the collision inevitably takes place in protoplanetary disks. To clarify whether or not dust aggregates can grow through their mutual collisions at relatively high velocities, we carry out more than 4000 runs of three-dimensional numerical simulations of collisions between icy equal-mass clusters formed under ballistic particle–cluster aggregation (BPCA) as well as those of ballistic cluster–cluster aggregation, including offset collisions with various values of the impact parameter. Since our BPCA clusters have a fractal dimension of 3 and a relatively compact structure, their results enable us to determine the criteria for growth and disruption of compressed aggregates at their collisions in protoplanetary disks. The results show that ice dust aggregates are able to grow at collisions with velocities up to 50 m s−1, in spite of their initial structures and impact parameters. We also find that the mass of ejecta relative to the total mass of colliding aggregates decreases with increasing the size of the aggregates. These results demonstrate the feasibility of growth and survival for dust aggregates through their mutual collisions with relatively high velocities in protoplanetary disks.}
