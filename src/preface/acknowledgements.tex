First and foremost, I wish to express my greatest gratitude to Prof. Dr. Cornelis (Kees) Dullemond,
for acting as my supervisor and providing me with invaluable advice and feedback while I was 
writing this thesis. \\

Second, I wish to thank Prof. Dr. Carsten Dominik, who kindly took on the role of second 
examiner. \\

Furthermore, I wish to thank the Planet Formation group and its members at the Heidelberg 
Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. 
Also, since this thesis probably marks the end of my time in Heidelberg, it needs to be said that 
I am extremely grateful for the last few years, and all the learning opportunities granted to me by
``Ruperto Carola'' University of Heidelberg, the Max Planck Institute 
for Astronomy, and now the Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. \\

Also, I wish to thank my mother for making it possible to study physics in Heidelberg,
as well as my father and grandmother, who from an early age on inspired me to be curious about 
the Universe. \\

% Lastly, I'd like to give a shoutout to my friends at DPSG Ulm-Söflingen.
